# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## What I Fixed

I noticed that a lot of the html had div tags seperating chuncks of code. There were no section tags at all. I wanted to make sure that the html was readable for me. I organized the code so that each section was noticeable as well.

In class, we went over how the header tag was originally a div tag with a class named header. The header tag makes the code easier to read. I did the same thing with the footer tag. It was originally a div tag.

After looking at the css, I realized that a lot of the code was repetative. That means that it can be simplified. I noticed that the css for the div, img, and h2 tags of the content class were all the same, so I combined them. I did the same thing for the benefits class

I noticed that the text and images would either collide or extend outside of it's box when the screen would get bigger or smaller. I realized that when the text throughout my page would change when the screen width was around 1020px. I made it so the css would change for those specific elements when the screen would reach that size or smaller. I also noticed that the image for social media marketing was overlapping the blue box it is in. I had to adjust the padding to fix the issue.
